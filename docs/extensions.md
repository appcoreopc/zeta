I'm would like to encourage people to write language extensions. I'll be
fairly open to include any PR for an extension in the Zeta repo under some
sort of "experimental" status. Multiple pattern-matching or regexp libraries
can "battle it out" and the ones favored by the users (and by me) will be
promoted to a "standard" library of sanctioned extensions after a while.
It will give those libs time to improve, get the kinks worked out, get more
tests added, etc.
